<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="uppercase"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> the Church Congress held this autumn at
Birmingham I was honoured by an invitation
to speak on &#8220;Sexual Relationships.&#8221;</p>

<p>The subject-matter of that speech has aroused
widespread interest and some controversy. It is
being published in response to numerous requests
and because most of the reports, being of necessity
condensed, inadequately and even in some instances
incorrectly set forth the views I endeavoured to
champion; for any speech on a subject so difficult
to handle needs to be read in its entirety if misapprehensions
are to be avoided.</p>

<p>And first, may I thank numerous correspondents;
and those in disagreement equally with those in
agreement with me. One and all they bear testimony,
if indeed such were needed, to how widespread
and responsible is the interest on this question,
and therefore to the wisdom of its full consideration.
Amongst the letters are intimate human
documents which pathetically disclose, as does professional
experience, how frequently happiness is
marred by ignorance of either the principles or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>methods which should condition the true conception
of sexual relationships.</p>

<p>I elected to deal with these relationships in their
healthy rather than their morbid aspects, because
the study of health is a sure way to lessen disease.
Mere denunciations of evil serve but small purpose.
The aim of statesmanship is rather to seek out causes
and ponder over remedies, and prominent among
remedies is surely the study of the significance and
purport of sex love in a well-ordered and Christian
community and provision for its healthy outlet. To
this the first part of my speech was devoted. The
view there upheld has brought forth a large measure
of agreement and no reasoned disagreement.</p>

<p>The second part of my speech dealing with birth
control (or what in strict accuracy should be called
conception control) has aroused more controversy,
but I venture to think that some, at least, of the
criticism directed against my argument will disappear
with a perusal of this full text of my speech. Therein
will be found condemnation of infertile marriages
and a strong plea that children are essential to the
health and happiness of man and woman, are necessary
to each other and of vital importance to the
nation.</p>

<p>The difference between my critics and myself is
not as to the vital necessity of the family following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>marriage, but rather this&mdash;they would like to see the
large families prevalent fifty years ago restored (and
where means and circumstances are favourable, such
large families may be the source of much happiness);
whereas under present-day conditions I should
regard them as seldom attainable and desirable, and
would favour smaller families of children born at
predetermined intervals.</p>

<p>A married couple who have produced four children
in twenty years cannot be said to have ignored the
precept &#8220;be fruitful and multiply and replenish the
earth&#8221; because they have so selected the times for
the conceptions of their children as to enable them
to give those children a better upbringing rather
than have selfishly left the sequence of their offspring
to blind chance.</p>

<p>The argument that the nation should foster large
families in order more quickly to people the untenanted
portions of the Empire, and so add to the
strength and wealth of the British Dominions,
requires serious attention, not in isolation, but in
conjunction with other considerations, and calls forth
varying opinions from economists.</p>

<p>On the other hand, emigration into <i>foreign</i> lands
would seem to be a source of weakness to a nation.
The feeding, clothing and educating of a young
Briton cost the nation a definite sum of money, say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>&pound;400; if at the age of twenty, when he is ready to
produce, that young Briton emigrates to a foreign
state, he is a definite loss to the country of his birth
and the country of his adoption is the gainer.</p>

<p>From another standpoint the criticism is made
that I have not urged the paramount necessity of
diminishing the population of these islands. With
the economic soundness of this view others are better
fitted to deal, but no economic considerations would
outweigh the importance of child life inspiring the
homes of the land, and if the number and sequence
of children can be regulated by the parents&#8217; circumstances,
these homes will increase in number, will
start when parents are younger and confer greater
benefits alike on the family and the State. If need
be, the State could grant a progressive rebate of
taxation, and educational facilities for each of three
children born after the second and where the father
is twenty-five years of age or upwards.</p>

<p>It is held by some that artificial birth control is
contrary to Christian morals. This is the view firmly
held by the Roman Catholic Church, and since the
governance of the Roman communion is based on
&#8220;authority,&#8221; its decisions are binding on its members
and command our respect. But pronouncements of
Protestant communions do not owe their force to
&#8220;authority,&#8221; but to the conviction they carry in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>the minds and consciences of their people, and no
clear scriptural sanction for the condemnation of
birth control has been given, nor does the report of
the Lambeth Conference vouchsafe any reasons why
it is physically and morally harmful.</p>

<p>A distinguished prelate of our Church has
characterised the views herein set forth as &#8220;very
unguarded.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> If by that expression he means
&#8220;careless,&#8221; he cannot have done me the honour of
reading my speech, which, whatever its demerits,
bears ample evidence of carefully considered thought
and expression. If by &#8220;unguarded&#8221; he means
&#8220;outspoken,&#8221; I will plead justification. For is it
not time that a question which deeply concerns not
only the thought, but the practice of the thinking
portions of communities should be fully considered
and its strength and its weakness disclosed by full
discussion? The world looks to its leaders for
reasoned guidance, not for assertion which may be
but the husk of a thought that has gone. What is
wanted is reasoned consideration, not unreasoned
condemnation. For churchmen and statesmen alike,
opportunism helps in situations which are small, but
never in those which are large; there clarity of principle
alone stands forth as a beacon to light the path.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Diocesan Conference at York.</p></div>

<p>The fear that discussion of this vital problem will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>endanger morality surely loses sight of the fact of
knowledge being so fundamental to our well-being,
that incidental dangers encountered along its path
must not deter us from its continued pursuit.</p>

<p>Moreover, it will be noticed that I have discriminated
between the principle of birth control
and the methods of its application, the latter being
preferably determined by the advice of the family
doctor rather than by the perusal of books in general
circulation.</p>

<p>The attitude of mind of the Church towards the
problems of sexual relationships is part of a larger
question, viz., the ever-widening gap between the
formal teaching of the Church and the actual belief
of the present generation, including many who by
baptism and early training belong to her fold.</p>

<p>This gap between authority and actuality of belief
imposes a strain on intellectual integrity and weakens
the foundations of a real allegiance. For those of
us who are of mature years the gap is bridged by the
tender associations of our childhood and the memory
of parents, for whom no such gap existed, and whose
faith and character have left indelible impressions on
our lives. But for the youth of to-day no such
bridge exists. The War has caused a hiatus and
thought has broken with tradition. Thus, youth is
no longer willing to accept forms and formul&aelig; only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>on account of their age. So it has set out on a voyage
of inquiry, and finding some things which are
doubtful and others which are insufficient, is searching
for forms of expression more in harmony with
the realities of life and knowledge. Although becoming
estranged in thought from the Church, it is
possessed of deep religious feeling and, firm on the
rock foundation of faith, is trying to build a superstructure
more in accord with the progress of
revelation, not only in religion, but in science, and
the needs of the world in which it moves and has its
being.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>LOVE&mdash;MARRIAGE&mdash;BIRTH CONTROL</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="uppercase"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ay</span> I make certain preliminary observations?
Painters and poets depict Love to us in golden
hues and arouse in us happy and sympathetic, and,
I trust, reminiscent response, helping us to realise
that life without the love of man and woman would
be like the world without sunshine.</p>

<p>Though, therefore, the social student in his
approach to the subject is not helped by the beauties
of colour and song, it behoves him to avoid undue
solemnity, and still more an air of portentous
foreboding.</p>

<p>In each age customs have been deplored as heralds
of evil, but the evils have seldom materialised.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties of this subject is that those
who are called upon to give counsel are apt to forget
the strength of the forces to be dealt with, for it is
during youth especially that sex attractions are so
powerful, and, may I add, so delightful. Middle-aged
people may be divided into three classes.</p>

<p>Those who are still young.</p>

<p>Those who have forgotten they were young.</p>

<p>Those who were never young.</p>

<p>And it is with the first class before my eyes that I
am privileged to address this audience.</p>

<p>I will confine my attention to the sexual relationships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>between unrelated adult people in youth and
prime.</p>

<p>It is common ground that sex love between such
people should be the physical expression of a lasting
affection, and be so intimately blended with the
feelings of helpfulness, sympathy, and intimate
friendship as to form a union of body, mind and
spirit. It further should be associated with the love
of and desire for children.</p>

<p>This complex is best secured by the institution of
marriage.</p>

<p>All its constituent features, except two, are vividly
realised in intimate friendship, and above all, in
that unique bond between mother and son which
with some of us is the most wonderful thing in our
lives.</p>

<p>Its two exclusively distinctive features are: <i>sex
love</i> and <i>child love</i>.</p>

<p>These are the real problems before us to-day,
particularly the former, and if in these remarks I
seem to concentrate on the problems of sex love, be it
understood I do so from a desire to save the time of
the meeting and not because I think sex love should
reign alone in unbalanced supremacy.</p>

<p>And by sex love I mean that love which involves
intercourse or the desire for such.</p>

<p>It is necessary to my argument to emphasise that
sex love is one of the clamant dominating forces of
the world. Not only does history show the destinies
of nations and dynasties determined by its sway&mdash;but
here in our every-day life we see its influence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>direct or indirect, forceful and ubiquitous beyond
aught else.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Imperious Instinct.</span></h3>

<p>Any statesmanlike review, therefore, will recognise
that here we have an instinct&mdash;so fundamental, so
imperious&mdash;that its influence is a fact which has to
be accepted: suppress it you cannot. You may
guide it into healthy channels&mdash;but an outlet it will
have, and if that outlet is inadequate or unduly
obstructed, irregular channels will be forced.</p>

<p>We uphold the control of sex love outside marriage
by the individual&mdash;and that we are right in so doing
is incontestable. But let us realise that in practice
self-control has a breaking point, and that if in any
community marriage is difficult or late of attainment,
an increase of irregular unions will inevitably result.</p>

<p>That the Church recognises this is shown by the
statement that marriage was instituted to prevent sin.
In considering the problem of illicit intercourse and
its attendant evils the social conditions that make for
a wholesome life are of more efficiency than Acts of
Parliament to suppress vice.</p>

<p>My desire, however, on this occasion is rather to
consider sex love in relation to marriage. The first
point I wish to make is that people need more
knowledge of the scientific bearings of sex relations
and more clearly defined guidance of their rightful
purport and practice. They are imperfectly provided
with both. We talk about instructing the
young when we are neither clear nor agreed amongst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>ourselves, and the young are endangered as much by
crudity as by absence of instruction.</p>

<p>All are agreed that union of body should be in
association with union of mind and soul; all are
agreed that the rearing of children is a pre-eminent
purpose. But what purport is there beyond these?
Here there is a lack of precision.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Church and Marriage.</span></h3>

<p>What does the Church service say? It says
&#8220;Marriage was ordained for a remedy against sin,
and to avoid fornication; that such persons as have
not the gift of continency might marry and keep
themselves undefiled members of Christ&#8217;s body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this is a very negative blessing. It implies
that where unfortunately people cannot be continent
that marriage gives the best way out&mdash;enables them
to get relief within the pale of virtue. This attitude
affords to sex love no positive purport or merit of
its own, and is in striking conflict with the facts of
life through the ages&mdash;facts which carry social
approval.</p>

<p>The recent pronouncement of the Church as set
forth in Resolution 68 of the Lambeth Conference
seems to imply condemnation of sex love as such,
and to imply sanction of sex love <i>only</i> as a means to
an end&mdash;namely, procreation, though it must be
admitted it lacks that clearness of direction which in
so vital a matter one would have expected. It almost
reminds me of one of those diplomatic formul&aelig;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>which is not intended to be too clear. Allow me to
quote from it:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In opposition to the teaching which under the
name of science and religion encourages married
people in the deliberate cultivation of sexual union
as an end in itself, we steadfastly uphold what must
always be regarded as the governing consideration
of Christian marriage. One is the primary purpose
for which marriage exists&mdash;namely, the continuation
of the race through the gift and heritage of children;
the other is the paramount importance in married
life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Facts of Life.</span></h3>

<p>Now the plain meaning of this statement is that
sexual union should take place for the sole purpose
of procreation, that sexual union as <i>an</i> end in itself&mdash;not,
mind you, <i>the</i> only end&mdash;(there we should all
agree), but sexual union as <i>an</i> end in itself is to be
condemned.</p>

<p>That means that sexual intercourse should rightly
take place <i>only</i> for the purpose of procreation.</p>

<p>Now the large majority of conceptions take place
immediately after and before the monthly period.</p>

<p>Quite a large family could easily result from quite
a few sexual unions. For the rest the couple should
be celibate. Any intercourse not having procreation
as its intention is &#8220;sexual union as an end in itself,&#8221;
and therefore by inference condemned by the
Lambeth Conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Think of the facts of life. Let us recall our own
love&mdash;our marriage, our honeymoon. Has not
sexual union over and over again been the physical
expression of our love without thought or intention
of procreation? Have we all been wrong? Or is
it that the Church lacks that vital contact with the
realities of life which accounts for the gulf between
her and the people?</p>

<p>The love envisaged by the Lambeth Conference is
an invertebrate joyless thing&mdash;not worth the having.
Fortunately it is in contrast to the real thing as
practised by clergy and laity.</p>

<p>Fancy an ardent lover (and what respect have you
for a lover who is not ardent)&mdash;the type you would
like your daughter to marry&mdash;virile, ambitious,
chivalrous&mdash;a man who means to work hard and
love hard. Fancy putting before these lovers&mdash;eager
and expectant of the joys before them&mdash;the
Lambeth picture of marriage. Do you expect to
gain their confidence?</p>

<p>They ask for bread; you give them a stone.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Allegiance of the Young.</span></h3>

<p>Authority, and I include under authority the
Churches, will never gain the allegiance of the
young unless their attitude is more frank, more
courageous, and more in accordance with realities.</p>

<p>And to tell you the truth, I am not sure that too
much prudent self-restraint suits love and its purport.
Romance and deliberate self-control do not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>to my mind, rhyme very well together. A touch of
madness to begin with does no harm. Heaven
knows life sobers it soon enough. If you don&#8217;t start
life with a head of steam you won&#8217;t get far.</p>

<p>Sex love has, apart from parenthood, a purport of
its own. It is something to prize and to cherish for
its own sake. It is an essential part of health and
happiness in marriage. And now, if you will allow
me, I will carry this argument a step further.</p>

<p>If sexual union is a gift of God it is worth learning
how to use it. Within its own sphere it should be
cultivated so as to bring physical satisfaction to both,
not merely to one. The attainment of mutual and
reciprocal joy in their relations constitutes a firm
bond between two people and makes for durability
of their marriage tie.</p>

<p>Reciprocity in sex love is the physical counterpart
of sympathy. More marriages fail from inadequate
and clumsy sex love than from too much sex love.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Passion a Worthy Possession.</span></h3>

<p>The lack of proper understanding is in no small
measure responsible for the unfulfilment of (connubial)
happiness, and every degree of discontent
and unhappiness may from this cause occur, leading
to rupture of the marriage bond itself. How often
do medical men have to deal with these difficulties,
and how fortunate if such difficulties are disclosed
early enough in married life to be rectified. Otherwise
how tragic may be their consequences, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>many a case in the Divorce Court has thus had its
origin.</p>

<p>To the foregoing contentions it might be objected
you are encouraging passion. My reply would be,
passion is a worthy possession; most men, who are
any good, are capable of passion.</p>

<p>You all enjoy ardent and passionate love in art
and literature. Why not give it a place in real life?</p>

<p>Why some people look askance at passion is
because they are confusing it with sensuality. Sex
love without passion is a poor, lifeless thing. Sensuality,
on the other hand, is on a level with gluttony&mdash;a
physical excess&mdash;detached from sentiment, chivalry,
or tenderness.</p>

<p>It is just as important to give sex love its place as
to avoid its over emphasis. Its real and effective
restraints are those imposed by a loving and sympathetic
companionship, by the privileges of parenthood,
the exacting claims of career and that civic
sense which prompts men to do social service.</p>

<p>Now that the revision of the Prayer Book is
receiving consideration, I should like to suggest,
with great respect, that an addition be made to the
objects of marriage in the Marriage Service, in these
terms: &#8220;The complete realisation of the love of this
man and this woman, the one for the other.&#8221;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Birth Control.</span></h3>

<p>And now, if you will permit me, I will pass on to
consider the all-important question of Birth Control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>First, I will put forward with confidence the view
that birth control is here to stay. It is an established
fact, and for good or evil has to be accepted. Although
the extent of its application can be and is being
modified, no denunciations will abolish it.</p>

<p>Despite the influence and condemnations of the
Church, it has been practised in France for well over
half a century, and in Belgium and other Catholic
countries is extending. And if the Roman Catholic
Church, with its compact organisation, its power of
authority, and its discipline, cannot check this procedure,
is it likely that Protestant Churches will be
able to do so?&mdash;for Protestant religions depend for
their strength on the conviction and esteem they
establish in the heads and hearts of their people.</p>

<p>The reasons which lead parents to limit their
offspring are sometimes selfish, but more often
honourable and cogent. The desire to marry and
to rear children well equipped for life&#8217;s struggle,
limited incomes, the cost of living, burdensome
taxation, are forcible motives; and, further, amongst
the educated classes there is the desire of women to
take a part in life and their husband&#8217;s careers, which
is incompatible with oft-recurring pregnancies.
Absence of birth control means late marriages, and
these carry with them irregular unions and all the
baneful consequences.</p>

<p>It is idle to decry illicit intercourse and interpose
obstacles to marriage at one and the same time.</p>

<p>But, say many whose opinions are entitled to our
respect: &#8220;Yes&mdash;birth control may be necessary, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>the only birth control which is justifiable is voluntary
abstention from connubial relations.&#8221; Such abstention
would be either ineffective or, if effective, impracticable
and harmful to health and happiness.</p>

<p>To limit the size of a family to, say, four children
during a child-bearing period of 20&ndash;25 years, would
be to impose on a married couple an amount of
abstention which for long periods would almost be
equivalent to celibacy, and when one remembers that
owing to economic reasons the abstention would
have to be most strict during the earlier years of
married life when desires are strongest, I maintain
a demand is being made which for the mass of
people it is impossible to meet; that the endeavours
to meet it would impose a strain hostile to health and
happiness and carry with them grave dangers to
morals.</p>

<p>Imagine a young married couple in love with each
other&mdash;the parents, say, of one child, who feel they
cannot afford another child for, say, three years&mdash;being
expected to occupy the same room and to
abstain for two years. The thing is preposterous.
You might as well put water by the side of a man
suffering from thirst and tell him not to drink it.</p>

<p>And further than that, if the efforts to abstain are
seriously made the strain involved is harmful to the
health and temper&mdash;if the efforts do not succeed the
minds of husband and wife are troubled by doubts
and anxieties which are damaging to their intimate
relationships. And, moreover, if this harmful
restraint succeeds in preventing conception there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>eventuates the inevitable prevalence of sex excitement
followed by abortive and half-realised satisfaction,
and the enhanced risk of the man or woman
yielding to outside sex temptations.</p>

<p>No&mdash;birth control by abstention is either ineffective,
or, if effective, is pernicious.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Home&#8217;s True Interests.</span></h3>

<p>I will next consider Artificial Control. The
forces in modern life which make for birth control
are so strong that only convincing reasons will make
people desist from it. It is said to be unnatural and
intrinsically immoral. This word unnatural perplexes
me. Civilisation involves the chaining of
natural forces and their conversion to man&#8217;s will and
uses. Much of medicine and surgery consists of
means to overcome nature.</p>

<p>When an&aelig;sthetics were first used at childbirth
there was an outcry on the part of many worthy and
religious people that their use under such circumstances
was unnatural and wicked, because God
meant woman to suffer the struggles and pains of
childbirth. Now we all admit it is right to control
the process of childbirth, and to save the mother as
much pain as possible. It is no more unnatural to
control conception by artificial means than to control
childbirth by artificial means. Surely the whole
question turns on whether these artificial means are
for the good or harm of the individual and the community!
Do all contraceptive measures damage the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>individual? The answer to that depends on the
purpose for which they are used. If they are
used to render unions childless or inadequately
fruitful they are harmful. There are grounds for
thinking that unrealisation of maternity favours
sterility.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, birth control before the first
child is inadvisable. On the other hand, the justifiable
use of birth control is to limit the number of
children, and to spread out their arrival in such a
way as to serve their true interests and those of
their home.</p>

<p>That such applications of birth control produce
no harm receives support from the study of the
numbers and distribution of the children of the
professional classes.</p>

<p>The advantage and disadvantage of this or that
contraceptive is a technical matter for the doctors
to determine.</p>

<p>Again, it has been stated that artificial control is
harmful because it leads to excessive indulgence.
Experience and evidence are against this being a
fact.</p>

<p>Contraceptives by the time and circumstance of
their application involve prudence and control. The
proper and efficient restraints on undue sexual
indulgence are to be found in mutual consideration,
sympathy, and tenderness and the pressing claims
of life&#8217;s duties.</p>

<p>The sensualist who is not deterred from excess by
these considerations will be completely careless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>whether his indulgence results in children or not&mdash;he
is moved by his selfish impulses alone.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Careful Distinction.</span></h3>

<p>Once more, careful distinction needs to be made
between the use and the bad effects of the abuse
of birth control. That its abuse produces harm
I fully agree&mdash;harm to parents, to families, and to the
nation. But abuse is not a just condemnation of
legitimate use. Over-eating, over-drinking, over-smoking,
over-sleeping, over-work do not carry
condemnation of eating, drinking, smoking, sleeping,
work.</p>

<p>But the evils of excessive birth control are very
real. There is first the individual&mdash;every woman is
better in body and mind for child bearing&mdash;the
periodic completion of the maternal cycle brings out
the best, preserves youth and maintains vital contact
with life. Maternity gives to woman her most
beautiful attributes. Fancy being mad enough to
suppress it! If one watches the woman with one
child and all maternity finished before thirty, and
compare her at forty with the woman of the same
age who has had, say, four children at proper intervals,
who usually has the advantage in preservation
of youth and beauty? Not the former.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must be admitted that baby
after baby every year or eighteen months wears and
often exhausts a woman&#8217;s strength. The inference
is that the use of birth control is good, its abuse bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Next, the children. Is it even necessary to refer
to the failure of the single-child household? Poor
little thing! Surrounded by over-anxious parents,
spoilt, no children to play with, bored stiff by adults.
And then, perhaps, illness, and it may be death&mdash;and
when it is too late to produce another.</p>

<p>Of the many tragedies I met in the war none
exceeded that attaching to the loss of only children.
It often means the end of all things; nothing to live
for&mdash;just blank despair.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Way of Happiness.</span></h3>

<p>The parents and the home both need children of
varying ages. That is the way of happiness and
enduring youth.</p>

<p>And lastly, the national aspect may be stated very
briefly. If England is not to lose her place in the
world her population must be maintained. Unless
fathers and mothers produce an average of over
three children that population will not be maintained.</p>

<p>If you say to a young husband and wife with
their one or two children, &#8220;Do you like to contemplate
that when you both leave life your country
will, through your action, be worse off than when
you entered life?&#8221; that is an appeal to patriotism,
and likely to be a successful appeal.</p>

<p>There are signs of a public opinion forming which
will condemn the selfishness of marriages without
their proper heritage of children, but such public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>opinion will not be strengthened by an indiscriminate
condemnation of birth control.</p>

<p>May I end my speech with an appeal that the
Church approaches this question, in common with
certain others, in the light of modern knowledge and
the needs of a new world, and unhampered by
traditions which have outworn their usefulness?</p>
